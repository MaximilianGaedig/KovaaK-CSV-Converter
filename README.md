# KovaaK-CSV-Converter



[This tracker](https://fat-dash.github.io/next/) isn't working for 2.0 versions and above and isn't maintained by the dev. So I made this program using python that changes the format of the CSV files.

Thanks to [sidtheone](https://github.com/sidtheone/fat-dash-fix), he saved me some work.

Just download the .exe and put it in your stats folder (usually at C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\FPSAimTrainer\FPSAimTrainer\stats), or to be safe, copy your stats folder to your desktop and put the program inside. Then just run it and click on Yes and then on Ok.
